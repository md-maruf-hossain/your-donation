            Due to continuous heavy rainfall since 17 May 2022, the north-eastern districts of Sylhet and Sunamganj in Bangladesh has been experiencing flash floods and landslides that have affected
            more than 2 million people. With major regional highways and access roads underwater, connectivity and transport to the affected areas have been blocked, resulting in a delay in
            assistance.

          <h3>Food for a family</h3>
          <p>
            Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster such as a tornado, flood, hurricane or blizzard. Texas families who live in disaster-prone areas may benefit
            from being prepared in the event of disaster. Knowing how to safely handle food and water in the immediate few days after the disaster can reduce stress, worry and inconvenience.

          <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
          <p>
            Flood affects housing structures severely, rendering them unusable without repair or reconstruction. However, in the case of floods, the homesteads remain submerged for a relatively long
            period of time before the repair or reconstruction work can be started.

          <h3>Education for a child</h3>
          <p>
            Academic activities in around 4,000 primary and high schools, colleges and madrasas in northern and northeastern districts of the country have been severely affected by monsoon flooding.
            Many schools have had to be shut down due to the flood. The number of affected education institutions is increasing across the country as new areas become flooded every day.
